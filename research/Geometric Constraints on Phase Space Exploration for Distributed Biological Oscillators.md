The core research question addresses the minimal phase space exploration required for N distributed KaiABC circadian oscillators to achieve global synchronization, leveraging dimensional bounds derived from the Kakeya Conjecture. The minimal required "volume," when interpreted through the lens of geometric measure theory, is defined by the **Hausdorff dimension** of the required phase space trajectory set, which is constrained by the mathematical cost of directional diversity.

### **1\. The Kakeya Dimensional Constraint and Phase Space**

The phase space of N coupled oscillators is the N-dimensional torus, TN. Synchronization requires trajectories to converge from arbitrary initial conditions (diverse phases) onto a low-dimensional synchronization manifold. The process of spanning all possible directions of phase difference during this transient exploration is constrained by geometric measure theory.

* **Dimensional Lower Bound:** The recently proven Kakeya Conjecture in three dimensions (Wang & Zahl, 2025\) confirms that any set of trajectories (analogous to Besicovitch sets or δ-tubes) that contains line segments pointing in every possible direction must have a Hausdorff dimension equal to that of the ambient space.1  
* **Minimal Exploration Dimensionality:** Applying this principle to the N-oscillator phase space, the minimum Hausdorff dimension (dmin​) of the set of system trajectories (E) required to explore all initial phase difference directions is bounded by N.4 This represents the inherent complexity of the space that must be traversed to ensure convergence from any starting point.

Minimal Dimension of Exploring Trajectories: dmin​(E)=N  
For the scenario involving **N=10 distributed devices**, the theoretical lower bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the explored phase space set is **10**.

### **2\. The Role of KaiABC Temperature Compensation (Q10​≈1.0)**

While the Kakeya constraint defines the **dimensionality** of the required exploration, the practical "volume" (the size of the synchronization basin) is determined by the system's susceptibility to heterogeneity, which the KaiABC system expertly minimizes.

#### **A. Environmental Heterogeneity Mitigation**

The challenge of N devices experiencing heterogeneous local environmental conditions (temperature variance σT​=±5∘C) is mitigated by the intrinsic properties of the KaiABC oscillator.

* **Q10 Coefficient:** Experimental evidence for the KaiABC circadian system consistently shows strong **temperature compensation**, with the period's sensitivity (Q10 value) measured at approximately 1.0.6  
* **Conversion to Frequency Variance (σω​):** Because the oscillation frequency (ω) is largely independent of temperature (dω/dT≈0), the substantial environmental variance (σT​) results in minimal natural frequency heterogeneity (σω​≈0) among the networked oscillators.7

#### **B. Impact on Synchronization Basin Topology**

The minimization of σω​ is the crucial factor that ensures a high-volume synchronization basin, reducing the distance and time trajectories must travel to synchronize.

1. **Critical Coupling (Kc​):** In the Kuramoto model, the critical coupling strength required for synchronization is proportional to the frequency heterogeneity (Kc​∝σω​).10 A near-zero σω​ minimizes Kc​, meaning that weak, low-bandwidth communication will be sufficient to achieve phase-locking.  
2. **Attractor Stability:** Large frequency heterogeneity (σω​\>0) often leads to complex dynamics such as **extensive chaos**, where the attractor's complexity, quantified by its Kaplan–Yorke fractal dimension, can grow linearly with N.12 These chaotic attractors reside in intricate, minimal-volume basins.  
3. **Maximal Basin Volume:** By driving σω​ toward zero, the KaiABC system effectively bypasses the bifurcations that lead to high-dimensional chaotic attractors. This stabilizes the large, simple, low-dimensional synchronization manifold (Dsync​≈1), thus **maximizing the volume of the basin of attraction** and minimizing the exploration time necessary for phase convergence.13

### **Summary of Minimal Exploration Volume**

The question of minimal "volume" is answered through two complementary constraints:

| Constraint | Physical/Geometric Measure | Value (for N=10) | Interpretation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Kakeya Bound (dmin​)** | Hausdorff Dimension of Trajectory Set E | 10 | Defines the minimum dimensional complexity required for the trajectory set to explore all phase difference directions. |
| **KaiABC Compensation (σω​≈0)** | Size of the Synchronization Basin | **Maximized** | Ensures the synchronization manifold is a large-volume, simple basin by preventing the formation of high-dimensional, fractal-boundary chaotic attractors. |

In essence, the KaiABC biological design solves the synchronization problem by **maximizing the size of the target attractor's basin** (reducing required exploration) rather than challenging the fundamental N-dimensional constraint on the exploring trajectories set.
